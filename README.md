Hello, it's Ash,
This is a game i'm working on with a friend of mine, he's doing the sprites ( npcs) 
and mostly of the map is some free source sprites we used for testing things out.
i'm working with the code stuff but i also do some art, 3d or 2d modelling,
be aware this is just a demonstration of the actual full game we plan to be working on,


Game Controls;
AWSD ; movement
Mouse Left ; Attack and look
Right Mouse ; Dash
Q-E ; Change Weapon


PS: hold your left button for like half a second so you can shoot with the gun,
the potion gives you the dash hability, and the swords gives you more xp.



enjoy,
cheers, 
asheey
